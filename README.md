# Blood Bank Management System

Blood, a vital constituent, is important in the life of every organism living on earth. Blood banks play an important role in storing and providing blood during treatment. An injured person may lose their life, if they are unable to get blood transfusion at the right time. Hence, there is an urgent need to establish a proper system where blood availability and contacting a blood donor is easily accessible to those in need. The Blood Bank Management System is a solution to all these problems, it can help in saving precious lives of people by making the process of getting the right blood at the right time a lot more efficient and time-saving.

## How can it be useful?
A blood bank plays a very important role in treatments of major injuries or surgeries. If blood is not supplied to a patient within a set period of time, the patient's chances of losing their lives increases dramatically. It is also obvious that conventional blood bank systems have a lot of disadvantages, they are quite time-consuming, error-prone and also lack in data-integrity. To overcome these problems, the project Blood Bank Management System is proposed. This project follows a hypothetical example of a blood bank named Abhishek Blood Bank, which is a charitable chain of blood banks with branches all over India. Abhishek Blood Bank wants to build an interactive and simple to use web application for day to day users. This application would maintain information of both blood banks as well as blood camps, hospitals and donors, which makes the entire process of blood transfusion easier. It will enable users to easily check availability of different blood types and also locate the nearest branches. They can also request a specific blood type easily and can also register themselves as donors. Donors can check for Blood camps and hospitals for blood banks.
